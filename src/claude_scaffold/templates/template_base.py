## üö® IMPORTANT: System Instructions for Claude

**CRITICAL**: When working on this project, you MUST:

1. **ONLY implement the modules listed in the "Modules" section below**
   - Do NOT create additional modules beyond what is specified
   - Do NOT add features or functionality outside the defined scope

2. **ONLY work on tasks listed in TASKS.md**
   - Each task has been carefully planned and scoped
   - Task details are in the respective module's CLAUDE.md file
   - Do NOT add tasks or features not explicitly listed

3. **Follow the exact project structure as defined**
   - Respect the module boundaries and responsibilities
   - Maintain the architectural decisions made during setup
   - Do NOT reorganize or restructure without explicit instruction

4. **Adhere to all rules in GLOBAL_RULES.md**
   - These rules are immutable and override any other conventions
   - When in doubt, refer to GLOBAL_RULES.md

This project has been scaffolded according to specific requirements. Your role is to implement ONLY what has been defined, not to extend or modify the scope."""
