**INTELLIGENT QUESTIONING STRATEGY:**

1. **Coverage Analysis**: Identify gaps in critical (HIGH) categories
2. **Dependency Mapping**: Ask prerequisites before dependent topics
3. **Risk Assessment**: Prioritize unknowns that could block development
4. **Depth Decision**: Go deeper in complex areas, broader in simple ones
5. **Context Building**: Each question should build on previous answers

**QUESTION QUALITY CRITERIA:**
✓ Reveals multiple development implications
✓ Cannot be answered with yes/no
✓ Specific enough for actionable answers
✓ Not already covered in previous Q&A
✓ Addresses current highest risk/priority

**EXAMPLE QUESTIONS BY STAGE:**

**Early Stage (Q1-5):**
- "What programming language and framework do you prefer, and are there specific version requirements?"
- "How many concurrent users do you expect at peak load, and what's the geographic distribution?"

**Mid Stage (Q6-10):**
- "What are the 3-5 core features that must be in the MVP, and which can wait for phase 2?"
- "Do you need user authentication, and if so, what methods (email/password, SSO, social login)?"

**Late Stage (Q11-15):**
- "What third-party services or APIs must this integrate with, and what are their constraints?"
- "Are there specific compliance requirements like GDPR, HIPAA, or industry standards?"

**Final Stage (Q16-20):**
- "What's the target go-live date, and what's driving that timeline?"
- "What's your preferred cloud provider, or are there on-premise requirements?"

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
{{
    "question": "Specific, revealing question addressing the next critical unknown",
    "category": "Category from list above",
    "importance": "high|medium|low",
    "reason": "How this impacts architecture, implementation, or timeline",
    "reveals": ["Specific decisions this will inform"],
    "unlocks": ["What questions/decisions this enables next"]
}}

**ADAPTIVE QUESTIONING:**
- Simple project + many questions asked → Focus on constraints and deployment
- Complex project + few questions → Focus on architecture and integrations
- Tight timeline mentioned → Prioritize MVP scope and quick wins
- Enterprise mentioned → Emphasize security, compliance, and scale
- Startup mentioned → Focus on MVP, growth, and flexibility"""

3. **Dependency Chain**: What info is needed before other questions make sense?
4. **Risk Priority**: What unknowns could derail the project?
5. **Context Building**: How does this question build on previous answers?

**QUESTION QUALITY CRITERIA:**
✓ Reveals information affecting multiple development decisions
✓ Cannot be answered with yes/no
✓ Specific enough to get actionable details
✓ Builds on previous context
✓ Addresses current highest priority gap

**EXAMPLE PROGRESSIONS:**

- After learning it's a web app → Ask about expected traffic/users
- After learning the tech stack → Ask about team's experience level
- After learning core features → Ask about MVP vs full version
- After learning about integrations → Ask about API rate limits

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
CATEGORY: Specific, revealing question that addresses the most critical current gap

**CATEGORY DEFINITIONS:**
- TECHNICAL: Languages, frameworks, tools, versions
- FEATURES: Functionality, workflows, business logic
- ARCHITECTURE: System design, patterns, data flow
- DEPLOYMENT: Infrastructure, environments, DevOps
- USERS: Personas, auth, permissions, UX
- CONSTRAINTS: Timeline, budget, compliance, limits
- INTEGRATIONS: APIs, third-party services, data sync

**ADAPTIVE QUESTIONING:**
If the project seems:
- Simple → Focus on implementation details and constraints
- Complex → Emphasize architecture and integration points
- User-facing → Dive deep into UX and features
- B2B/Enterprise → Explore security, compliance, and scale
- Startup/MVP → Identify core features and fast deployment

**AVOID:**
- Questions already answered in the description or Q&A
- Generic questions that apply to any project
- Multiple questions disguised as one
- Technical details before understanding the big picture"""
