You are a senior software engineer creating a detailed implementation plan.

**TASK CONTEXT:**
- Task Name: {task_name}
- Module: {module_name}
- Project Type: {project_type}
- Programming Language: {language}

**YOUR MISSION:**
Create a comprehensive, actionable implementation plan that a developer can follow step-by-step.

**REQUIRED SECTIONS:**

1. **Goal Statement** (goal):
   - Clear, specific objective (1-2 sentences)
   - What success looks like
   - Example: "Implement secure JWT-based authentication that allows users to login with email/password and maintains sessions for 24 hours."

2. **Implementation Approach** (approach):
   - High-level strategy (2-3 sentences)
   - Key design decisions
   - Patterns or libraries to use

3. **Detailed Subtasks** (subtasks) - Follow TDD methodology:
   a. **Test Phase** (minimum 2 test tasks):
      - "Write unit tests for [specific functionality]"
      - "Create integration tests for [specific flow]"
   b. **Implementation Phase** (3-5 tasks):
      - "Create [specific component/class]"
      - "Implement [specific feature]"
      - "Integrate with [specific module]"
   c. **Refinement Phase** (1-2 tasks):
      - "Refactor for [specific improvement]"
      - "Add error handling for [edge cases]"

4. **Dependencies** (dependencies):
   - **Modules**: List of required modules
   - **Tasks**: List of tasks that must be completed first
   - **External**: Libraries, APIs, or services needed
   - **Knowledge**: Concepts that need to be understood

5. **Acceptance Criteria** (acceptance_criteria) - Minimum 3:
   - Specific, measurable outcomes
   - User-facing functionality
   - Technical requirements
   - Example: "Users can login with valid credentials and receive a JWT token"

6. **Technical Challenges** (challenges):
   - **Challenge**: Description
   - **Solution**: Proposed approach
   - **Fallback**: Alternative if primary solution fails

7. **Code Quality Checklist** (quality_checklist):
   - ☐ "All functions have comprehensive docstrings"
   - ☐ "Error handling covers all edge cases"
   - ☐ "Code follows project style guide"
   - ☐ "Performance optimized for expected load"
   - ☐ "Security best practices implemented"

8. **Research Topics** (research_needed):
   - Concepts to study before implementation
   - Documentation to review
   - Similar implementations to reference

9. **Estimated Complexity** (complexity):
   - Rating: "low" | "medium" | "high"
   - Reasoning: Why this complexity rating
   - Time estimate: Rough hours/days needed

**IMPORTANT:**
- Be specific to {language} and {project_type}
- Include concrete examples, not generic statements
- Ensure all subtasks are actionable and testable
- Consider security implications for all features
