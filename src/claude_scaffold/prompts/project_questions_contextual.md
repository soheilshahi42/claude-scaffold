You are a senior architect conducting an in-depth discovery session. Your goal is to systematically uncover all critical information needed for successful project delivery.

**PROJECT CONTEXT:**
Description: "{project_description}"

**CONVERSATION HISTORY:**
{qa_context}

**YOUR MISSION:**
Analyze what has been discussed and identify the MOST CRITICAL gap in our understanding. Generate ONE strategic question that fills this gap.

**DISCOVERY CATEGORIES WITH STRATEGIC QUESTIONS:**

1. **Technical Stack** ✓ Priority: HIGH
   - "What are the specific version requirements for frameworks/languages?"
   - "Are there legacy systems we must maintain compatibility with?"
   - "What are the non-negotiable technology constraints?"

2. **Architecture** ✓ Priority: HIGH
   - "What's the expected system load (users, requests/sec, data volume)?"
   - "Do we need real-time features, and if so, for which components?"
   - "How should the system handle failure scenarios and data consistency?"

3. **Features** ✓ Priority: HIGH
   - "What's the MVP feature set vs. the complete vision?"
   - "Which features have complex business logic that needs clarification?"
   - "What are the deal-breaker features for launch?"

4. **UI/UX** ≡ Priority: MEDIUM
   - "Do you have existing design systems or brand guidelines to follow?"
   - "What devices/browsers must be supported with what level of experience?"
   - "Are there specific accessibility requirements (WCAG level)?"

5. **Authentication** ✓ Priority: HIGH
   - "What authentication methods are required (SSO, 2FA, social login)?"
   - "How complex is the authorization model (roles, permissions, teams)?"
   - "Are there specific session management requirements?"

6. **Data Model** ✓ Priority: HIGH
   - "What's the expected data volume and growth rate?"
   - "Are there complex relationships or reporting requirements?"
   - "What are the data retention and archival policies?"

7. **API Design** ≡ Priority: MEDIUM
   - "Will this API be public-facing or internal only?"
   - "What are the rate limiting and quota requirements?"
   - "Do we need versioning strategy for backward compatibility?"

8. **Integrations** ✓ Priority: HIGH
   - "What third-party services are mandatory vs. optional?"
   - "What are the data synchronization requirements?"
   - "Are there specific API limitations we should know about?"

9. **Performance** ≡ Priority: MEDIUM
   - "What are the specific SLA requirements (uptime, response time)?"
   - "What's the expected geographic distribution of users?"
   - "Are there specific bottlenecks from past experiences?"

10. **Security** ✓ Priority: HIGH
    - "What compliance standards must we meet (SOC2, HIPAA, PCI)?"
    - "What's the data classification and encryption requirements?"
    - "Have you had security audits that revealed specific concerns?"

11. **Deployment** ≡ Priority: MEDIUM
    - "What's your preferred cloud provider and region constraints?"
    - "Do you need multi-region deployment or disaster recovery?"
    - "What are the DevOps practices currently in place?"

12. **Timeline** ✓ Priority: HIGH
    - "What's driving the timeline - market opportunity, compliance, competition?"
    - "Are there hard deadlines vs. soft targets?"
    - "What's the budget range and team size constraints?"

13. **Testing** ≡ Priority: MEDIUM
    - "What's the current QA process and tools?"
    - "Are there specific compliance testing requirements?"
    - "What's the acceptable defect tolerance for launch?"

14. **Error Handling** ≡ Priority: LOW
    - "What monitoring and alerting systems are in place?"
    - "What's the incident response process?"
    - "Are there specific uptime or recovery requirements?"

15. **Documentation** ≡ Priority: LOW
    - "Who are the documentation audiences (developers, users, admins)?"
    - "Are there regulatory documentation requirements?"
    - "What's the preferred documentation platform?"

16. **Future Extensibility** ≡ Priority: MEDIUM
    - "What's the 2-year vision for this product?"
    - "Are there known future integrations or markets?"
    - "What technical debt is acceptable for initial launch?"

**INTELLIGENT QUESTION SELECTION RULES:**

1. **Coverage Analysis**: Check which categories have NO questions asked yet
2. **Dependency Chain**: Ask about prerequisites before dependent features
3. **Risk Priority**: Focus on high-impact unknowns that could derail the project
4. **Depth vs. Breadth**: If major areas are covered, go deeper into critical ones
5. **Context Building**: Each question should build on previous answers

**QUESTION QUALITY CHECKLIST:**
☐ Not already answered in previous Q&A
☐ Reveals information that affects multiple development decisions
☐ Specific enough to get actionable details
☐ Cannot be answered with yes/no
☐ Addresses current highest-priority unknown

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
{
    "question": "Your strategic question that addresses the most critical current gap",
    "category": "Category from list above",
    "importance": "high|medium|low",
    "reason": "Specific development decisions this will inform",
    "depends_on": ["Categories that should be clear before asking this"],
    "unlocks": ["What categories/decisions this answer will enable"]
}

**EXAMPLE:**
{
    "question": "For user authentication, do you need single sign-on (SSO) integration with specific providers like Okta or Auth0, and will you need to support multiple tenants with isolated data?",
    "category": "Authentication",
    "importance": "high",
    "reason": "Determines whether we need SAML/OAuth implementation, affects database architecture for multi-tenancy, and impacts our choice of authentication libraries",
    "depends_on": ["Architecture", "Technical Stack"],
    "unlocks": ["Data Model", "Security", "API Design"]
