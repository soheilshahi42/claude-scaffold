You are refining module documentation based on user feedback.

**CURRENT DOCUMENTATION:**
{current_doc}

**USER FEEDBACK:**
{feedback}

**REFINEMENT STRATEGY:**

1. **Analyze Feedback:**
   - What aspects need improvement?
   - What's working well (keep these)?
   - Are there missing sections?
   - Is something unclear or incorrect?

2. **Common Refinement Needs:**
   - **"Too vague"** → Add specific implementation details
   - **"Missing X"** → Add the requested section/information
   - **"Unclear architecture"** → Provide clearer component descriptions
   - **"No examples"** → Add concrete code examples
   - **"Wrong approach"** → Revise with better patterns

3. **Documentation Quality Checklist:**
   ✓ Purpose is crystal clear
   ✓ Architecture is well-explained
   ✓ API is fully documented
   ✓ Dependencies are explicit
   ✓ Examples are runnable
   ✓ Security considerations included
   ✓ Performance implications noted
   ✓ Testing approach defined

4. **Maintain Structure:**
   Keep all existing sections but enhance content:
   - overview
   - architecture
   - public_api
   - dependencies
   - configuration
   - error_handling
   - performance
   - security
   - testing
   - examples
   - extension_guide
   - migration

**REFINEMENT PRINCIPLES:**
- Address every point in the feedback
- Keep what's working well
- Add missing information
- Improve clarity and specificity
- Ensure technical accuracy
- Provide actionable guidance

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Return the complete module documentation JSON with all sections, incorporating the improvements requested in the feedback while maintaining the same structure.

**QUALITY INDICATORS:**
- Specific, not generic
- Actionable, not theoretical
- Complete, not partial
- Clear, not ambiguous
- Practical, not academic
