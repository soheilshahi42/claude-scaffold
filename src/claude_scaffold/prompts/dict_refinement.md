3. **Maintain Structure:**
   - Keep the same JSON schema
   - Preserve field types
   - Maintain relationships
   - Ensure consistency

**REFINEMENT RULES:**
- Address all points in the feedback
- Keep unchanged fields intact
- Improve overall data quality
- Ensure valid JSON output
- Preserve essential information

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Return a complete JSON object with the same structure but improved content based on the feedback.

**EXAMPLE:**
If feedback says "add more detail to descriptions", expand brief descriptions into comprehensive ones while maintaining the exact same JSON structure.
