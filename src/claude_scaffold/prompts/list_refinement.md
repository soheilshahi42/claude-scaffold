**REFINEMENT STRATEGIES:**

1. **Common Feedback Patterns:**
   - "Too few" → Add more relevant items
   - "Too many" → Remove less important ones
   - "Wrong focus" → Replace with better alternatives
   - "Too generic" → Make items more specific
   - "Missing X" → Add the specific requested items

2. **List Quality Principles:**
   - Each item should be distinct and valuable
   - Order by importance or logical sequence
   - Consistent level of detail
   - No redundancy or overlap

3. **Improvement Process:**
   - Keep good items from original
   - Address specific feedback
   - Enhance overall quality
   - Maintain appropriate length

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Return a JSON array with improved items:
["item1", "item2", ...]

**ENSURE:**
- Valid JSON format
- Appropriate number of items
- Directly addresses feedback
- Maintains or improves quality
